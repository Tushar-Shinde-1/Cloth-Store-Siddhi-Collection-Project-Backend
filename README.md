# Cloth Store Siddhi Collection - Backend

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository contains the **backend** for the Cloth Store Siddhi Collection project.  
We already have a **frontend repository**, but to work on both **frontend and backend simultaneously**, this backend has been separated into its own repo.  

This allows us to **enhance frontend and backend in parallel** without conflicts.
